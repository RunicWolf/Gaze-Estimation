# UnityEyes

UnityEyes is a application that generates synthetic but realistic eye images that are 
 annotated with various pieces of information such as eye region locations and look vector. 
 
You can generate your own training images using the software which can be found at https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes/

Please add your images to the `datasets/UnityEyes/imgs/` folder.
